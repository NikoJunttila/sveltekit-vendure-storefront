sveltekit vendure storefront with starting point coming from this repo: https://github.com/pevey/sveltekit-storefront

use different browser for vendure backend and storefront because of cookie overlap

vendure needs stripe plugin and my custom paytrail plugin or just remove paytrail code from code,
